1
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,856
"Haruki-ya"

2
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,706
Groups of unemployed workers, who have
grown in number due to the tax reforms

3
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:05,043
enacted by the former Prime Minister,
are rioting all across the country.

4
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:08,588
And with the confusion among members
of Parliament sparked by the comments of

5
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:12,091
Finance Minister Takanashi
during a recent Parliament inquiry,

6
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,596
there seems to be no compromise in sight
between the government and opposition.

7
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:18,473
Hey. What'll it be?

8
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,850
Give me three peanuts.

9
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:24,229
Let's see here...

10
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,329
We've herded those
Clown bastards onto Route 5.

11
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,793
Damn it, don't scare me like that!
Open the damn door quietly!

12
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:50,505
You wouldn't be so jumpy if
you didn't have something to hide!

13
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:54,425
Try selling some normal
drinks sometime, huh?

14
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:58,555
How about buying something
for once?! This ain't a hangout!

15
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:01,057
And drink that dog piss you sell?!

16
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:08,940
Twin ceramic rotor drives on each wheel...

17
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:14,320
And these are... Computer
controlled anti-lock brakes...

18
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:17,782
200 horsepower at 12,000 rpm...

19
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,328
You wanna ride it, Tetsuo?

20
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:24,914
All right, let's go!

21
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,795
That bike's been customized just for me.
It's too wild. You couldn't handle it.

22
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:34,215
I don't see how you can
ride something like that, man.

23
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,802
I could!

24
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:41,139
If you want one so bad,
steal a big one for yourself.

25
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:47,830
Unbelievable.

26
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,917
School kids these days...

27
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,628
Wait! Hey, waiter!

28
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:59,842
They ran into the alley! After 'em!

29
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:16,025
This isn't a game, you idiot!

30
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:20,905
Shit...!

31
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:25,344
That's--

32
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:27,930
This is car 375.

33
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,061
We've got reports of biker gangs fighting
near the intersection of Highway 14 south!

34
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:37,940
Request immediate assistance!
Car 375, en route to the scene!

35
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:39,525
It's the cops! What should we do?

36
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:42,862
Damn, and my motor coils
were just getting warmed up...

37
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,452
Bastards...

38
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,537
Let's go, Tetsuo!

39
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:52,747
Right!

40
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,499
Damn!

41
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,053
A skirmish has broken out
between student protesters

42
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:10,056
and riot police assigned as security.
There appear to be some casualties.

43
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,474
Furthermore--

44
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:29,534
What the--?

45
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,704
What the hell's going on?!

46
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:36,457
Move it, jerk! I'm in a hurry!

47
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:53,224
What was that?!

48
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:54,892
Call the police!

49
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:04,902
Repeal the tax reforms!

50
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:27,091
This area is off-limits!
Go back! It's dangerous!

51
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,301
Something's strange here...

52
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,178
Let me through! I'm sorry, let me through!

53
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:32,013
What's the big idea?

54
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:41,355
Look! Blood!

55
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:43,232
Who are they?

56
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:44,525
--Excuse me.
--Hey! Don't push!

57
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:45,318
Excuse me.

58
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,486
Hey! Watch it, jerk!

59
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,242
Pardon me. I'm sorry.

60
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:54,660
Ryu!

61
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,662
Hey! He ran away!

62
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:04,086
He's got a gun!

63
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,929
Fire!

64
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:15,473
Hold your fire! There's a kid with him!

65
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,902
Run...

66
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,029
Hurry...

67
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:35,868
Go to Ryu...

68
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,955
Ryu will help you now...

69
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:46,128
Hurry... Get out of here...

70
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:18,786
Kei!

71
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,291
What are you doing? Hurry!

72
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:29,171
He vanished...!

73
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,057
He's to the west.

74
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:43,477
The west? He's in the old city, then.

75
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,573
Eat this!

76
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,754

81
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:24,161
No, that's--!

82
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,017
How you like that?!

83
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,737
Well? Who is it?

84
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,449
It's not him! It's not Tetsuo!

85
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,451
Okay! Let's go!

86
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:13,544
You little... What did you do...?

87
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:29,226
Tetsuo! Hang on! Hey!

88
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:32,730
Huh? What did you say?

89
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,607
That kid...

90
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,237
He's hurt bad!

91
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:43,657
Hey! Wait!

92
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:44,742
We gotta get him to a hospital!

93
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,579
--He needs an ambulance!
--We can't move him!

94
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,924
W-What the hell?!

95
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,232
There's no escape.

96
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,782
We've come for you.

97
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:36,043
We can't survive on the outside.
Come on, let's go home.

98
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,923
It's the army! Those are army helicopters!

99
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:49,348
Move out!

100
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,194
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!

101
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:05,114
Um... We're just, uh...

102
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,575
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!

103
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:19,253
Ow... Damn it, that hurts!

104
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,671
Kai!

105
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:27,261
Hey!

106
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,429
Sir?

107
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:29,305
Who are they?

108
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,640
They seem to be an ordinary bike gang, sir.

109
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,284
We're going back.

110
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,077
Ow! Hey, wait a minute!

111
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:54,079
My arms don't bend that way, damn it!

112
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:57,291
Load the wounded onto the helicopter!

113
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,417
Tetsuo!

114
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:01,003
Wait! Where are you taking him?

115
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,755
Kaneda!

116
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,924
What the hell? We didn't do anything!

117
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,010

So you and your friends went out at night
on your bikes to visit your dying mother,

123
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:18,080
and a group of hooligans called
the Clowns picked a fight with you.

124
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,541
They hurt your friend,
so you lost your temper,

which is why eight Clown
members are now in the hospital.

Hey! You can't look at this!

129
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,344
And how's your mother doing?!

Huh? Oh.

131
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,348
Luckily, she made it
through the worst of it last night.

And I suppose she's made it over
the mountains on a bike by now?

It couldn't be these bozos.

we gonna have to wait?

So the army's working with the police to
hunt down anti-government groups now, huh?

--Wanna put up a fight, huh?

All right, that's enough! Take him away!

We'll really teach him a lesson later.

just hang yourself or something!

Hey! You people can go.
We've contacted your school.

149
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,057
What? You son of a--

150
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,559
Hey, hold on a minute, pops!

151
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,144
"Pops"?!

152
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,230
There was one more of us.

153
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:07,272
What?

154
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:08,899
Pardon me.

What're you--

156
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,114
This is her. Can she leave with us?

157
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,951
Who are you calling "Pops," you punk?

158
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,244
Ow!

159
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:24,957
Look here, kid! I'm only 25!
I'm not even married!

So watch your mouth! She can go with you!

161
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:32,923
Call a doctor!

162
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:37,636
So I think the army was chasing
that weird kid Kaneda saw...

163
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:39,721
I think I saw him, too.

164
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,431
And what about Tetsuo?

165
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,017
Why the hell wouldn't they
tell us what hospital he's in?

166
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,602
What did you say?!

167
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:49,147
I was just wondering if you wanted to
grab some tea or something over there.

168
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:54,736
I figured we could have a nice,
long talk about that "revolution" deal.

169
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:58,907
Skirt-chasers will try anything these days...

170
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,827
You'll help anyone so
long as they're a girl, won't you?

171
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,746
No way! I have high standards!

172
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,749
It's not their looks that count.

173
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:11,753
It's their... I dunno, their
sensitivity that moves me.

174
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:16,091
I suppose I owe you one.
Thank you very much, uh...

175
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,593
I'm Kaneda. Nice to meet you.

176
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,137
See you around, Kaneda.

177
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:23,056
You're leaving already? Don't be like that!

178
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:27,394
Hey, come on! I did save you and all!

179
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:34,943
At least tell me your name, you bitch!

180
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:41,074
I'll try talking with them for
the time being, but it's risky.

181
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:46,413
If they think you're trying to avoid taking
responsibility, it'll blow up in your face.

182
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:50,250
I can't believe that there's a
mole on the executive council.

183
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,002
Even if that's true...

184
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,046
That isn't important.

185
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:58,508
What's important is diplomacy and political
maneuvering, which you seem to despise.

186
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,928
I never studied them in school, you see.

187
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,889
In any case, at the next
executive council meeting,

188
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:09,603
your poor management of this last
incident will be called into question.

189
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:15,233
There's a phone call for the Colonel.

190
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:20,030
You should put your affairs in order.

191
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,118
It's me.

192
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,808
This way, Colonel.

193
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,811
I'm terribly sorry to call you here,

194
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,064
but there's something you really must see.

195
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,653
Please observe.

196
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:02,906
It's the special pattern from that young boy.

197
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:05,117
It doesn't resemble any I've seen so far,

198
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:08,245
and I've never seen a developmental
speed or configuration like this.

199
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:12,916
It may have begun with the shock of
contact with Number 26, or possibly...

200
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,585
Have you finished running a
comparison with Akira's pattern?

201
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,629
I'll superimpose it over this one.

202
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:27,764
This projection was constructed using
mixed data, so a comparison is difficult,

203
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:31,935
but I believe this boy's
pattern is the key to solving

204
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:34,896
the riddle of Akira's pattern growth process.

205
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,690
All right. Continue.

206
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,400
Very well, sir. Thank you.

207
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:42,195
I'm sure he'll turn out to be a
worthy addition to the Numbers.

208
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:45,407
It may be rough on him,

209
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:48,952
but I thought we might try
starting him off with level 7 capsules.

210
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:50,245
Is it safe?

211
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:51,496
Leave everything to me.

212
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,749
That's not what I meant!

213
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:58,754
I'm asking that if he turns out to
have power like Akira's like you said,

214
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:02,466
will we be able to control it?

215
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,593
Well, that's--

216
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,428
Can I leave this to you?

217
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:11,892
Well, if we use the latest examination
equipment to collect even more data

218
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,812
and do a multifaceted
analysis, then surely...

219
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:22,360
Maybe we shouldn't touch that power.

220
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,697
The power of God?

221
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:30,577
A... ki... ra...

222
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:36,666
But we have to. We have
to touch it and control it.

223
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:40,587
If it looks like it's too much for us
to handle, terminate him at once!

224
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:42,422
There can be no hesitation!

225
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:44,549
Very well, Colonel.

226
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:48,095
"Ward 8 Vocational Training School"

227
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:52,349
If trash like you, that can't keep up with
the academic ability of regular students

228
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:56,561
and can't adapt to living in a group,
screw up here, it's the end of the road!

229
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,232
Even if you're under 15, if you get more
than 50 penalty points on your record,

230
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,567
you're sent to the regular courts!

231
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:05,070
Bite me! Don't mess with us, you bald goat!

232
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,696
Aren't any of you listening?

233
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:09,282
--You lost me halfway through!
--Discipline!

234
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:10,575
Discipline!

235
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:11,910
--Discipline!
--Ow!

236
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,412
Discipline! Discipline!

237
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:15,789
Discipline!

238
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,707
Dismissed!

239
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:21,545
Thank you very much, sir!

240
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,757
You bastard! You and me are
gonna go at it someday, jack!

241
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:26,842
We're gonna remember this!

242
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,051
I hope you rot and die!

243
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,803
You sick bastard!

244
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,179
Shit...

245
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,186
Yamagata!

246
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,105
What happened to your cheek?

247
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:41,439
Shut the hell up.

248
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,400
Let me guess, Jaws from P.E.?

249
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:46,319
They say you fought the
Clowns on a highway in the old city!

250
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:46,736
Yeah.

251
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:50,073
Why don't you just wipe 'em out?
Those guys are so gross!

252
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:51,700
And last night...

253
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,702
There were demonstrators,
cops, and even the damn army!

254
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,745
And that idiot Tetsuo had an accident, too.

255
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:57,414
What happened to Tetsuo?

256
00:24:57,622 --> 00:24:59,416
He's in the hospital.
I guess, but we don't know where.

257
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,918
The idiot was trying to show off.

258
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,047
That idiot...

259
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,049
What, you mean Tetsuo?

260
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:11,052
Shut up! I've had enough
of your damn flirting!

261
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,597
What's gotten into you?!

262
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:32,157
Tetsuo? It's time for your medication.

263
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,077
Doctor! There's a problem!

264
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:44,419
I can't. The dorm mother
throws a fit if you go out before 10.

265
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:47,380
Yeah, the one with the face like a goat.

266
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:51,426
That old bag's such a pain...
She's always yammering on and on and on.

267
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:54,179
Tomorrow at three? Sure, that'd be okay.

268
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:57,557
Hey, what happened
to that girl a while back?

269
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:01,561
I don't like her much.
Her personality just gets on my nerves.

270
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,521
Kaori...

271
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,942
Tetsuo!

272
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,863
Everyone's been worried about you!
They thought you might be dead.

273
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:22,415
When I woke up, I was on an
operating table or something.

274
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,626
And that examination...

275
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:29,172
It's like... they were messing
around inside my head.

276
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:31,841
I don't want to go back there.

277
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,551
Let's run away...

278
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,845
Where?

279
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:41,309
Someplace. Someplace far away.

280
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,814
--What's your problem?
--That's mine!

281
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:46,898
I wanna get laid!

282
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:48,900
Hey! Today's independent study!

283
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:53,947
Say what? What about
my burning desire to study?!

284
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,949
Drag his butt in here!

285
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:58,910
Kaneda! Your bike!

286
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,620
My bike?

287
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:03,540
Look!

288
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:08,211
Tetsuo!

289
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:11,339
Are you sure this is okay?

290
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,050
Shut up! Just keep quiet and hang on!

291
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:23,351
"On Limits"

292
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:25,895
Huh?

293
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:27,564
What's wrong?

294
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:30,567
Shit!

295
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:31,526
Oh, no...

296
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:36,364
"End the Shimamoto
Labor Union's Illegal Strike! !"

297
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:39,909
Oh, okay. The engine can't drop below
5,000 even when you're changing gears.

298
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:42,412
--My butt hurts.
--Okay, I get it...

299
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,997
Look, bikes!

300
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:46,916
Is that Kaneda and...?

301
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,836
It's not them!

302
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:53,840
Kaori!

303
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:58,595
Any sign of him?

304
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:00,847
Kuwata and the others
went to look around Kisarazu.

305
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:03,767
All that's left now is the industrial area!

306
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:06,061
Okay. let's go!

307
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:12,192
We owe you for the other night!

308
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:21,951
Shut up!

309
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:27,123
Kaori! What did they do, Kaori?!

310
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:39,302
Don't! If you so much as scratch
that bike, I'm gonna kill you!

311
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:45,934
Run!

312
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:47,644
Don't let 'em get away!

313
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:55,819
Wait!

314
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:06,996
Tetsuo!

315
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:16,673
"Smash the Strike! !"

316
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,057
That's enough, Tetsuo!
Are you trying to kill him?

317
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:29,102
Yes! I'm gonna kill him!
I'll split his damn head open!

318
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,895
Knock it off!

319
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:34,983
This happened because
you took my bike for a joyride.

320
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:35,900
Enough, already!

321
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:39,696
Shut up! Don't order me around!

322
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:41,406
We were worried about you.

323
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:45,326
Why do you always have
to come and save me?

324
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:49,914
I could've handled it myself!
I admit I got beat up that one time,

325
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:53,751
but I won't always be on the receiving end!

326
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,171
Understand?!

327
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:02,469
Tetsuo...

328
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:04,929
Shut up! Stay away from me!

329
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:10,560
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

330
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:12,562
Leave me alone!

331
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,565
Akira!

332
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:20,987
Tetsuo!

333
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,450
What's wrong?

334
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,076
Akira!

335
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,162
I don't know who that is!

336
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:53,811
Tetsuo, are you...

337
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,355
Hey!

338
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,319
This is strange.

339
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:04,405
I'm getting a blue pattern on scope #3!

340
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:08,201
Oh, no! Retrieve the subject! Hurry!

341
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:24,259
What're you doing to my friend?!

342
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:31,808
What's with you?
You just come back from a funeral?

343
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:39,524
Tetsuo!

344
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,234
Kaneda!

345
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,279
Shit...

346
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:54,581
Wait!

347
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:03,756
Hey, Kaneda...

348
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:20,189
I see we have some youngsters doing
their thing in spite of the tight checkpoints.

349
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:23,526
That just means that they're stupid, don't it?

350
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:31,492
This is boring. Hey, let's go home.

351
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:33,202
But it's still early!

352
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:37,206
Yeah, but without their bikes
they're just skirt-chasers out of water.

353
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:38,416
You mean "fish"!

354
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:41,961
Come on, let's go. Let's toss these fish back!

355
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:46,174
Hey, Kaneda, what're we gonna do?

356
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:49,469
What the--?

357
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:50,887
Look!

358
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,414
That's...

359
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:22,377
Here we go again... Let's get out
of here before we get involved again.

360
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,337
Huh?

361
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:25,463
Kaneda?

362
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,006
Hey!

363
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:32,387
This area is being cordoned
off due to a terrorist bombing.

364
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:34,347
Those who wish to get
through, line up in single file,

365
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:38,518
present your ID and go through the checkpoint.

366
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:49,696
Get in.

367
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:53,866
What's wrong? Hurry. I'll be right behind you.

368
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:56,077
You know the rendezvous point, right?

369
00:33:57,078 --> 00:34:00,456
--Be careful.
--You too, Ryu.

370
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:09,382
"We're the Clowns"

371
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:16,097
Stop! Stop. damn it!

372
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:19,475
She's got a gun!

373
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:32,989
Okay, that's far enough!

374
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,532
Drop the gun!

375
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:43,541
Drop it now!

376
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:51,132
Stop!

377
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:06,314
I think it came from over here!

378
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:08,149
--There were two shots!
--No, three!

379
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:09,901
It's just up ahead!

380
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:12,737
Hey. Let's get out of here.

381
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,197
Come on!

382
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:47,772
"Idiot <i>I</i> Moron <i>I</i> Fool <i>I</i> No. 1"

383
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:21,973
Kaneda!

384
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:51,586
So, what's the matter?
Try telling me about it.

385
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:54,422
I had a dream.

386
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,257
A dream?

387
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,763
The city will be covered by a
dark shadow and start to crumble.

388
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:05,349
Lots of people died...

389
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:09,729
...and we met Akira again.

390
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:11,105
Akira?!

391
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:18,279
The city will crumble,
and so many people will die...

392
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:22,199
When?! When will it happen, Kiyoko?!

393
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:25,244
You mustn't let that boy go.

394
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:28,664
His power, it...

395
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:35,922
What did she mean?!

396
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:41,886
Well, there's nothing
physically wrong with her.

397
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:43,387
Her medication is normal. too.

398
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:48,059
There's no sign of any abnormalities
in her ECG or EEG, either.

399
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:53,773
I think what Number 25 said
was her precognitive power at work.

400
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:58,653
This must be presented to the
supreme executive council for inquiry, but...

401
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:00,529
Do you believe her?

402
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:02,990
I have no doubts
regarding Number 25's abilities.

403
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:05,910
We have all sorts of data
that substantiate her abilities.

404
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:08,621
What about you, Colonel?

405
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:13,209
My job isn't to believe or disbelieve.
It's to act or not to act.

406
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:26,847
Here, sir.

407
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:31,268
Cold gear, Colonel.
Please put it on. You, too, Doctor.

408
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:47,201
The other day, a young
researcher asked me something.

409
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:51,372
He wondered if their power was the form
the next stage of human evolution was taking,

410
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:56,961
and perhaps that we'll all
be able to control it someday.

411
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:59,922
Scientists are a bunch of romantics.

412
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:03,092
Military men always consider the risks first.

413
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,720
It's taken thirty long years.

414
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:09,765
We've come so far from the rubble.

415
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:11,934
We can't just trade one for the other.

416
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:16,731
I've always thought that
you hated this city, Colonel.

417
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:22,194
The passion to build has cooled
and the joy of reconstruction forgotten,

418
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:26,157
and now it's just a garbage heap
made up of hedonistic fools.

419
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:30,077
So you're trying to save the city, then.

420
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:33,622
It's how a soldier thinks.
A scientist wouldn't understand.

421
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:39,587
Colonel, we're here.

422
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:40,880
This way, sir.

423
00:40:01,275 --> 00:40:04,820
Room 10, 148 degrees Kelvin.

424
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:07,573
Fluctuation tolerance range, check.

425
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:12,161
Room 9, 118 degrees Kelvin.
Fluctuation tolerance, check.

426
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:15,039
Emergency power generator, check.

427
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,082
Open it.

428
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,500
Yes, sir.

429
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:18,000
Uh...

430
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:19,335
Go to the Control Room!

431
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:20,753
Yes, sir!

432
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:43,317
Room 1 is at 0.0005 degrees Kelvin.
It's within tolerances.

433
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:48,405
No abnormalities detected in any of the
rooms' Dewar Walls or in the defense system.

434
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:52,243
No abnormal atmospheric
concentrations or reactions recorded.

435
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:55,204
All systems nominal, then?

436
00:41:04,213 --> 00:41:07,424
Look at what they abandoned
in their panic. They were afraid!

437
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,969
They were too scared,
so they hid it away from the public.

438
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:12,388
They forgot all shame and honor

439
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:16,934
and cast off the civilization
and science we had created,

440
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:21,689
and shut the lid of the Pandora's Box
they themselves had opened.

441
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:26,735
Ryu!

442
00:41:26,944 --> 00:41:29,071
Hey, we're still young.

443
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,740
I think we can start over.

444
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:33,159
I'll go with you to the police.

445
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:34,118
Ryu!

446
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,744
Come on, turn yourself in!

447
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:37,997
That was the first time you
ever killed somebody, right?

448
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:38,664
Ryu!

449
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:41,625
Anyway, once you've
purified your body and soul,

450
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:44,003
let's go out for tea or something.

451
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,172
Don't kick yourself over it, okay?

452
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,342
What's done is done. The guy's dead.

453
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:59,435
Who're you?!

454
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:02,146
RY"! You're okay!

455
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,773
--Kei, is that you?
--Ryu!

456
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:07,234
Who's this?

457
00:42:07,443 --> 00:42:08,777
Who, me?

458
00:42:08,986 --> 00:42:14,950
Well, I guess saying I'm Kei's
boyfriend might be stretching it a bit.

459
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:18,537
But we haven't gotten physical
or anything yet, understand?

460
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:19,622
<i>“Are you“ a Spy?'
“No! '!</i>

461
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,498
Liar!

462
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:27,296
Is he really okay?

463
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:30,883
All I know for sure is that he's not a spy.

464
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,885
Ow...

465
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:36,263
Sneak into their lab?!

466
00:42:36,472 --> 00:42:38,891
Are you serious? Don't you
remember the fiasco with that kid?!

467
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:43,020
Last-minute orders.
Besides, the plan's already in place.

468
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:48,484
The lab passes that they issue once a week...

469
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:50,527
They're from Mr. Nezu?

470
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:51,987
What's the objective?

471
00:42:52,196 --> 00:42:54,782
Detailed data on the new subject.

472
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,408
New subject?

473
00:42:56,617 --> 00:43:03,582
Yes. Last week, on the night we tried
to abduct the subject called Number 26,

474
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:08,420
a boy who was in an accident on an
old city highway was brought to the lab.

475
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:11,048
Looks like he's a student
at a vocational training school.

476
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:14,760
But he's now their new subject
for human experimentation.

477
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:19,640
Ow!

478
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:23,227
Ow! What's the big idea?!

479
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:24,228
You!

480
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:25,813
He heard us! Let's kill him!

481
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:26,563
Ryu!

482
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:30,609
W-Wait a minute! Listen to me!
Listen to what I have to say!

483
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:31,735
He saved me!

484
00:43:31,944 --> 00:43:33,070
Twice!

485
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:35,155
Maybe it was just to get close to us.

486
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:38,742
The guy who was in that accident
in the old city is a friend of mine!

487
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:41,912
I know it's hard to believe, but it's the truth!

488
00:43:42,121 --> 00:43:44,707
I was there when it happened!

489
00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:48,752
Don't they say the only foolish
questions are unasked ones?

490
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:51,797
Huh? They don't?

491
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:55,884
That's an intriguing story.

492
00:43:56,093 --> 00:43:58,887
Will you be taking the boy with you?

493
00:43:59,096 --> 00:44:03,642
He knows the subject, and I think
we can use him as a decoy if necessary.

494
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:07,396
Neo Tokyo is going to change.

495
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:12,860
In all respects, this city is
saturated. It's like an overripe fruit.

496
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:15,696
And within it is a new seed.

497
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:19,867
We only need to wait for
the wind which will make it fall.

498
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:23,037
The wind called Akira!

499
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:26,415
Ryu. look!

500
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:27,791
What is it?

501
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,502
We aren't the ones who will change it,

502
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:34,715
but rather, those citizens
who hope for Akira will.

503
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:38,552
That which is called
science perverts providence!

504
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:41,972
That which is called progress
encourages extravagance!

505
00:44:41,972 --> 00:44:43,807
"The Day of Awakening is Near!"
"Pamphlets 500 yen"

506
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:46,518
That which is called civilization
devastates the spirit of man!

507
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:50,564
The time of atonement is upon us!

508
00:44:50,773 --> 00:44:52,775
The time of his awakening is nigh!

509
00:44:52,775 --> 00:45:04,119
"Lord Akira the Enlightened"

510
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:04,203
Break up this illegal gathering!

511
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:07,289
Terrorist activities carried out by

512
00:45:07,498 --> 00:45:10,918
anti-government elements
have skyrocketed this month.

513
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:15,172
The army, riot police, and even
traffic police have been fully mobilized.

514
00:45:15,381 --> 00:45:18,592
The overtime costs alone have
used up the public safety budget.

515
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:21,011
And then there's the abduction of Number 26!

516
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,223
Isn't their existence supposed
to be highest of state secrets?

517
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:27,810
No one's ever heard of "Peace
and Order" here in Neo Tokyo, then?

518
00:45:28,018 --> 00:45:31,397
And then there's this request of yours

519
00:45:31,605 --> 00:45:36,443
for further funding because
of subject Number 25's prediction.

520
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:38,028
You must be joking!

521
00:45:38,237 --> 00:45:43,325
We Parliament members have been
begging the public to bear with us

522
00:45:43,534 --> 00:45:48,622
while we straighten out the former
Prime Minister's historic tax reform blunders,

523
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:51,750
so where, exactly, are we
supposed to get that kind of money?!

524
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:56,463
You've spent a fortune, and all we have to
show for it is that grotesque kindergarten!

525
00:45:56,672 --> 00:45:59,091
The Olympics are next year.
The postwar period is over.

526
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:02,761
How much longer will you keep
spending money on some ghost?!

527
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,973
I always said that we should've put
that money into the welfare program!

528
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:07,141
Shut up, old man!

529
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:08,142
What?!

530
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:12,020
That power is starting to
walk around free as we speak.

531
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:17,609
--Unless we control it now, we'll lose everything!
--Who do you think you're talking to, youngster?

532
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:20,654
It was your lack of policy that
started this mess in the first place!

533
00:46:20,863 --> 00:46:25,284
There's still no proof that the
last World War was caused by Akira!

534
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:29,413
Won't you even try to
understand anything at all

535
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:31,415
unless an Akira disaster actually happens?!

536
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:34,001
Has anyone actually seen this "Akira"?

537
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:36,295
Wasn't Akira Number 25?

538
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:38,589
No, I think he was Number 21...

539
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:42,509
The Colonel has lost
sight of his duty as a soldier.

540
00:46:42,718 --> 00:46:44,845
I've had reports that
anti-government elements are using

541
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:50,726
this "Akira" madness of yours as an
excuse to whip up their terrorist fervor!

542
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:52,853
No! That's untrue!

543
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:55,481
Then what about that
Akira world renewal movement?

544
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:57,566
Wouldn't you say that
information's being leaked?

545
00:46:57,774 --> 00:47:01,069
World renewal movement?
End of the world, more like!

546
00:47:01,278 --> 00:47:04,948
Aren't you just using Akira as
camouflage to cover up your misconduct?

547
00:47:05,157 --> 00:47:06,783
What are you getting at?

548
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:15,501
Colonel, we can no longer leave the
peace of Neo Tokyo to your sole discretion.

549
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:16,460
Right!

550
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:19,880
You are to be put before an inquiry committee.

551
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:21,340
<i>I</i> agree!

552
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:26,512
Excuse me!

553
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:28,847
Colonel! Colonel, where are you--

554
00:47:29,056 --> 00:47:31,517
Wait! This discussion isn't over yet!

555
00:47:31,725 --> 00:47:32,809
Explain yourself!

556
00:47:33,018 --> 00:47:36,063
Are you trying to insult the
supreme executive council?!

557
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:37,022
Colonel...!

558
00:47:37,231 --> 00:47:38,857
Wait, Colonel!

559
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:03,048
W-Water...

560
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,416
Hey, wait a minute...

561
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:41,044
Isn't that cable replacement
scheduled for next week?

562
00:48:41,253 --> 00:48:44,590
The cable they ordered came in early.

563
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:48,927
Besides, I'm going on vacation
at the end of the week.

564
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:51,763
"Verify Pass Cards"

565
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:52,097
I've brought some workers with me, too.

566
00:48:52,306 --> 00:48:57,269
I could take it back, but the
work's gonna be done sooner or later.

567
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:04,276
Okay, let's go.

568
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:35,575
What the--?

569
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:06,398
Milk?

570
00:51:14,573 --> 00:51:16,324
Stay away!

571
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:29,880
Blood!

572
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:31,465
I'm scared!

573
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:42,017
Jerk!

574
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:44,352
W-Who the hell are they?

575
00:52:39,908 --> 00:52:43,537
Room 887, Tetsuo Shima...

576
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:45,664
A problem with the automatic lock?

577
00:52:50,919 --> 00:52:54,339
Hey! You can't just walk off from your room!

578
00:52:58,969 --> 00:53:00,345
Come on, let's go back.

579
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:03,682
What the hell happened? What a mess!

580
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:30,333
There are 58 blocks with circuits
that the computer won't display.

581
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:34,880
Of those, nearly 40 are concentrated
on underground levels 7 and 8.

582
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:36,464
That's probably the place.

583
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,011
The central wiring shaft should be up ahead.

584
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:43,847
We should be able to use it
to go straight to the sublevels.

585
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:48,351
Be careful. It's deeper in the middle.

586
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,936
What a stink!

587
00:53:50,145 --> 00:53:50,812
Quiet!

588
00:53:51,021 --> 00:53:54,024
What? I said it stinks because it stinks!

589
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:56,943
--Is your nose busted?
--Hurry up and stay quiet!

590
00:53:58,528 --> 00:54:00,989
Damn! Hide!

591
00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:02,407
Huh? Where?

592
00:54:02,616 --> 00:54:04,784
What're you doing, you idiot?!

593
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,050
They left?

594
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:21,718
Looks like they've beefed up security.

595
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:23,470
Must be that siren we heard.

596
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:24,930
What should we do? Scout around some?

597
00:54:25,138 --> 00:54:26,431
No.

598
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,682
--Are you okay?
--Let's keep going.

599
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:30,185
I want to check out their
security at the very least.

600
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:31,353
All right.

601
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:34,230
We've been spotted! Run!

602
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:35,523
Shit!

603
00:54:35,732 --> 00:54:38,652
Don't! Don't shoot!

604
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:44,950
Shimazaki! Shit!

605
00:54:45,158 --> 00:54:46,993
Forget about him! Run!

606
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:52,791
What the hell is that?

607
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:55,126
Here it comes!

608
00:54:55,961 --> 00:54:58,171
Forget it! You can't do any good!

609
00:55:02,968 --> 00:55:04,803
Die!

610
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,180
This is Unit 304, Shaft H!

611
00:55:07,389 --> 00:55:11,226
I have encountered intruders
and am engaging! Request backup!

612
00:55:11,768 --> 00:55:13,103
Here it comes!

613
00:55:39,254 --> 00:55:40,505
Kei!

614
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:44,509
Where's that gun?!

615
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:47,053
Damn it...!

616
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:50,765
Kaneda!

617
00:56:00,734 --> 00:56:02,569
Kei, this way!

618
00:56:03,486 --> 00:56:06,531
Hurry!

619
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:09,200
Kaneda, hurry!

620
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:25,967
Kaneda!

621
00:56:38,688 --> 00:56:40,690
The brakes! Where are the brakes?!

622
00:56:40,899 --> 00:56:41,941
That's not it?

623
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:43,943
This is the central wiring shaft!

624
00:56:44,152 --> 00:56:45,862
It's gotta be this one, then!

625
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:54,788
Okay, I'm getting the hang of this!

626
00:56:54,996 --> 00:56:57,082
Ask the Colonel for clearance to fire!

627
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:59,209
Turn that up!

628
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:00,710
There must be some mistake.

629
00:57:00,919 --> 00:57:03,421
That boy looks like the
patient they admitted to the lab.

630
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:06,800
The boy, the subject named
Tetsuo Shima, broke out of his room.

631
00:57:07,008 --> 00:57:08,843
I think he's headed for the Baby Room.

632
00:57:09,052 --> 00:57:10,011
Tetsuo?!

633
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:12,931
He is in an extremely dangerous
state! Don't let him through!

634
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:15,934
I repeat, do not let him through!

635
00:57:43,962 --> 00:57:45,130
What the--?

636
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,347
It's no use hiding.

637
00:57:54,556 --> 00:57:56,516
We have no choice, then. Use your guns!

638
00:57:56,724 --> 00:58:00,061
We can't let him go any
farther, no matter what it takes!

639
00:58:01,062 --> 00:58:02,730
Fire!

640
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:44,689
So, here you are...

641
00:58:49,903 --> 00:58:51,404
Stop it!

642
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:56,326
How long are you
gonna keep playing around?!

643
00:59:03,124 --> 00:59:05,293
Where'd the other one go?

644
00:59:06,586 --> 00:59:08,129
Why, you...

645
00:59:09,339 --> 00:59:10,840
Die!

646
00:59:13,218 --> 00:59:14,802
Takashi!

647
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:30,026
What the hell is going on?
Am I dreaming or something?

648
00:59:30,235 --> 00:59:33,738
I never knew I had powers like this!

649
00:59:40,662 --> 00:59:43,039
Damn it, which way should I go?!

650
00:59:43,248 --> 00:59:46,668
Straight. Straight ahead...

651
00:59:46,876 --> 00:59:47,752
Huh?

652
00:59:47,961 --> 00:59:50,713
There's a freight elevator.

653
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:55,009
We can take it to sublevel 8.

654
01:00:03,142 --> 01:00:05,853
Good, you're all together.

655
01:00:07,313 --> 01:00:10,233
You thought you could kill me?

656
01:00:10,984 --> 01:00:15,488
You tried to mess with me...
I'm gonna kill you!

657
01:00:20,827 --> 01:00:23,037
That was you--

658
01:00:23,246 --> 01:00:24,497
Takashi!

659
01:00:24,706 --> 01:00:26,541
Attack him together!

660
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:28,835
O-Okay.

661
01:00:33,214 --> 01:00:35,008
You little twerps!

662
01:00:51,566 --> 01:00:53,359
That's enough! All of you!

663
01:01:01,576 --> 01:01:03,619
Who the hell are you?!

664
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,209
What's the matter?
Does your head hurt, Tetsuo Shima?

665
01:01:10,418 --> 01:01:12,211
Your power isn't fully matured.

666
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,547
If you push yourself,
you might do irreparable damage.

667
01:01:14,756 --> 01:01:16,716
Just do as we tell you.

668
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:21,971
What the hell did you people do to my head?!

669
01:01:30,146 --> 01:01:32,148
Calm yourself, Tetsuo Shima!

670
01:01:32,357 --> 01:01:34,484
He can't control it.

671
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:40,365
What?!

672
01:01:40,573 --> 01:01:46,120
She said that big people like you
should never use the power like that.

673
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:48,706
She says something horrible will happen.

674
01:01:48,915 --> 01:01:51,000
Mind your own business.

675
01:01:53,378 --> 01:01:56,964
What? More powerful than me?

676
01:01:59,217 --> 01:02:04,180
He's the one! He's been popping
in and out of my head lately!

677
01:02:04,389 --> 01:02:07,141
Where is he?! Where's this "Akira"?!

678
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:07,683
What?!

679
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:12,021
Kiyoko said that you'll awaken Akira.

680
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,982
If that happens, no one
will be able to stop him.

681
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:16,734
So before that can happen,
we have to stop you.

682
01:02:16,943 --> 01:02:18,694
Impossible! Akira's already--

683
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:21,989
Where is he?!

684
01:02:23,032 --> 01:02:24,158
Stop it!

685
01:02:24,367 --> 01:02:25,952
Shut up!

686
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:35,044
Threat level to facility
integrity has passed level 7.

687
01:02:35,253 --> 01:02:39,215
Enacting disaster protocols.

688
01:02:39,424 --> 01:02:42,802
Threat level to facility
integrity has passed level 7.

689
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:46,097
Enacting disaster protocols.

690
01:02:46,305 --> 01:02:47,765
What the--?!

691
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:56,607
Hands "P!

692
01:02:59,569 --> 01:03:01,821
Where the hell is the "Baby Room"?!

693
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:15,668
Oh, no! Run!

694
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:22,717
Gangway, coming through! Coming through!

695
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:24,594
Damn it, move!

696
01:03:26,512 --> 01:03:28,055
Kiyoko...

697
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,452
Damn, that hurt...

698
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:53,581
Kaneda? What're you doing here?

699
01:03:56,042 --> 01:03:59,587
Tetsuo! Are you okay?
I'm here to rescue you!

700
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:05,801
Hurry up, you moron! If we don't get
out of here, those guys outside are gonna--

701
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:09,931
There he is! Catch him!

702
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:14,393
Stay away from me!

703
01:04:18,064 --> 01:04:19,607
Kaneda!

704
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:26,072
Oh, right. I forgot you were there, Kaneda.

705
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,282
That's okay, Kaneda.

706
01:04:28,491 --> 01:04:32,870
I won't be needing you to save me anymore.

707
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:35,790
From now on, I'll be saving you.

708
01:04:35,998 --> 01:04:39,085
All you have to do is ask, Kanny.

709
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:44,340
Say what? Who the hell do
you think you're talking to?!

710
01:04:45,091 --> 01:04:47,718
You don't like the way I talk?

711
01:04:47,927 --> 01:04:49,303
Does it make you mad?

712
01:04:49,512 --> 01:04:51,013
Well, what're you gonna do about it?!

713
01:04:51,222 --> 01:04:55,434
Huh, Kaneda?! What're
you gonna do about it?!

714
01:05:04,485 --> 01:05:09,865
That's enough! Don't hurt anyone else!

715
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:13,786
Where's this "Akira" guy?!

716
01:05:13,995 --> 01:05:15,997
He...

717
01:05:16,205 --> 01:05:19,333
The Olympic stadium...?
In an underground facility?

718
01:05:19,542 --> 01:05:23,129
No! You're wrong! Akira is--

719
01:05:24,797 --> 01:05:26,591
Wait!

720
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:40,563
What the hell? I can do this, too?!

721
01:05:46,402 --> 01:05:48,321
Kiyoko, are you okay?

722
01:05:48,529 --> 01:05:50,239
It doesn't look like she's hurt.

723
01:05:50,448 --> 01:05:53,034
What about you, Masaru? You're bleeding.

724
01:05:53,242 --> 01:05:55,202
What happened to him?

725
01:05:55,411 --> 01:05:56,495
He flew away.

726
01:05:56,704 --> 01:05:59,332
How can he have so much power...?

727
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,212
How could this have
happened? Is anyone here?

728
01:06:05,421 --> 01:06:09,008
He's developed so much
power in such a short time...

729
01:06:09,216 --> 01:06:11,260
Find him! Find Tetsuo!

730
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:14,722
--Find him! Go after him!
--Kaneda! Hang on, Kaneda!

731
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:17,892
Hurry up! Get that rubble cleared!

732
01:06:19,894 --> 01:06:21,520
He went to where Akira is.

733
01:06:21,729 --> 01:06:25,524
What? You're all safe!

734
01:06:25,733 --> 01:06:29,320
He's heading for the facility
below the Olympic construction site.

735
01:06:29,528 --> 01:06:31,530
How did Tetsuo find out about that?!

736
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:39,080
You mean he's gone outside?

737
01:06:41,374 --> 01:06:44,794
Damn it! We'll follow him! Prepare for pursuit!

738
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:46,212
--Yes, sir!
--He's heading west!

739
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:48,964
He's heading for the
Olympic construction site!

740
01:06:49,173 --> 01:06:51,801
Tell them to beef up their security!

741
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:54,011
--You...!
--Set up checkpoints on all...

742
01:07:00,226 --> 01:07:04,480
According to the defense team, intruders
were encountered in the wiring shaft.

743
01:07:04,689 --> 01:07:06,565
--Two disguised as workers resisted
and were shot, and the rest are at large.

744
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:10,778
--He has to be stopped before his powers mature... --Two disguised
as workers resisted and were shot, and the rest are at large.

745
01:07:11,821 --> 01:07:14,532
Your objective is the boy Tetsuo Shima.

746
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:17,993
If we are unable to capture him, you will
lure him out to the old city and attack.

747
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:20,454
Request assistance from
the Eastern District Battalion.

748
01:07:20,663 --> 01:07:20,955
Yes, sir!

749
01:07:21,163 --> 01:07:23,374
Tell them there isn't a moment to lose!

750
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:28,003
I've been waiting for you, Colonel.

751
01:07:29,088 --> 01:07:30,756
Who the hell are you?!

752
01:07:32,425 --> 01:07:36,595
I'm here to inform you of the
supreme executive council's decision.

753
01:07:38,389 --> 01:07:42,518
At 2400 hours today, the Colonel is
hereby stripped of his command and rank,

754
01:07:42,727 --> 01:07:44,937
and will be placed under arrest.

755
01:07:45,146 --> 01:07:46,564
What?!

756
01:07:47,314 --> 01:07:49,650
Please come with us.

757
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:54,155
You expect me to hand Neo Tokyo
over to those fools at a time like this?

758
01:07:56,949 --> 01:07:58,200
--Shoot him.
--Yes, sir!

759
01:07:58,409 --> 01:08:00,202
What?

760
01:08:00,411 --> 01:08:02,121
W-Wait!

761
01:08:03,372 --> 01:08:07,126
Enough! Open your eyes
and look at the big picture!

762
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:10,629
We can't dance to the tune of
corrupt politicians and capitalists!

763
01:08:14,675 --> 01:08:18,345
Don't you understand?!
It's pointless to fight anymore!

764
01:08:22,475 --> 01:08:26,687
Announce a state of emergency,
arrest all members of the executive council

765
01:08:26,896 --> 01:08:29,482
and remove them from
the chain of command!

766
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,358
We're going after Tetsuo!

767
01:08:31,567 --> 01:08:35,571
Urgent message to all
district battalion commanders!

768
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:44,038
"Haruki-ya"

769
01:08:45,206 --> 01:08:49,251
Hey, what's up? You by yourself?

770
01:08:51,212 --> 01:08:53,547
Weren't you in an accident or something?

771
01:08:53,756 --> 01:08:57,092
Everybody's been worried.
So, you feeling better?

772
01:08:57,301 --> 01:09:00,846
Gimme some... capsules.

773
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:04,600
Hey, are you sure about that?
You don't look so hot.

774
01:09:04,809 --> 01:09:07,812
Just hand 'em over!

775
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:09,897
All right, if you say so.

776
01:09:10,105 --> 01:09:14,235
But with all those demonstrations and
terrorist attacks lately, things are rough.

777
01:09:14,443 --> 01:09:18,614
They're hard to come by,
so they're pretty expensive.

778
01:09:24,829 --> 01:09:29,375
Tetsuo's run off, Kaneda's disappeared...
I guess the team's finished.

779
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:35,130
And the checkpoints are so strict,
even the Clowns are staying put.

780
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:45,808
What's wrong?

781
01:09:46,392 --> 01:09:47,560
"This End Up"

782
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:50,229
He's dead!

783
01:09:50,437 --> 01:09:51,814
What?!

784
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:55,484
What the--?

785
01:10:00,739 --> 01:10:01,866
Tetsuo?

786
01:10:02,074 --> 01:10:06,704
What are you doing here?

787
01:10:06,912 --> 01:10:09,540
You want some, too?

788
01:10:09,748 --> 01:10:13,168
What are you talking about, damn it?!
What the hell happened here?!

789
01:10:13,377 --> 01:10:15,754
The barkeep's dead!

790
01:10:18,966 --> 01:10:21,802
A fish out of water dies, huh?

791
01:10:22,011 --> 01:10:27,933
You are Tetsuo... Aren't you?

792
01:10:28,142 --> 01:10:30,185
Kaneda sends his regards.

793
01:10:30,394 --> 01:10:31,687
You saw Kaneda?!

794
01:10:31,896 --> 01:10:34,982
He's probably dead by now...

795
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:41,030
You did this, Tetsuo?

796
01:10:41,238 --> 01:10:45,576
So anyway... Where's Kaneda's bike?

797
01:10:45,784 --> 01:10:46,952
Tetsuo!

798
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:50,080
I don't need a piece of
junk like that anymore...

799
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:51,707
You son of a...

800
01:10:57,421 --> 01:10:58,881
Yamagata!

801
01:11:05,387 --> 01:11:07,306
Shit...

802
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:15,940
He went to where Akira is?

803
01:11:16,148 --> 01:11:18,150
That's what that girl said.

804
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:22,571
The army, you, and Ryu are
all looking for this "Akira" guy,

805
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:24,865
so that's why you're chasing after Tetsuo.

806
01:11:25,074 --> 01:11:29,161
It has something to do with
that power of Tetsuo's, right?

807
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,914
What the hell is this "Akira"
thing you keep talking about?

808
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:39,380
Ryu told me about it once.
He said that Akira is absolute energy.

809
01:11:39,588 --> 01:11:41,423
Absolute energy?

810
01:11:41,632 --> 01:11:45,427
Humans do all kinds of
things during their lifetime, right?

811
01:11:45,636 --> 01:11:49,890
Discovering things, building things...

812
01:11:50,557 --> 01:11:57,606
Things like houses, motorcycles,
bridges, cities, and rockets...

813
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:01,777
All that knowledge and energy...
Where do you suppose it comes from?

814
01:12:03,362 --> 01:12:06,782
Humans were like monkeys once, right?

815
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:10,494
And before that, like reptiles and fish.

816
01:12:10,703 --> 01:12:14,623
And before that, plankton and amoebas.

817
01:12:14,832 --> 01:12:19,044
Even creatures like those have
incredible energy inside them.

818
01:12:19,253 --> 01:12:22,506
Because of genes, I guess.

819
01:12:22,715 --> 01:12:27,636
And even before that, maybe
there were genes in the water and air.

820
01:12:27,845 --> 01:12:30,222
Even in space dust, too, I bet.

821
01:12:30,431 --> 01:12:34,685
If that's true, what
memories are hidden in it?

822
01:12:34,893 --> 01:12:38,522
The beginning of the universe, maybe.
Or maybe even before that.

823
01:12:38,731 --> 01:12:42,526
Hey, what's the matter? Are you okay?

824
01:12:42,735 --> 01:12:45,070
Did you get hit on the head back there?

825
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:48,866
Maybe everyone has those memories.

826
01:12:49,074 --> 01:12:51,827
What if there were some mistake
and the progression went wrong,

827
01:12:52,036 --> 01:12:56,665
and something like an amoeba
were given power like a human's?

828
01:12:58,292 --> 01:13:00,753
That's what Akira is?

829
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:04,048
Amoebas don't build houses and bridges.

830
01:13:04,256 --> 01:13:06,842
They just devour all the food around them.

831
01:13:07,051 --> 01:13:11,597
That's what Tetsuo's doing?
You're saying he has that kind of energy?!

832
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:16,268
A long time ago, there were people
who tried to control that power.

833
01:13:16,477 --> 01:13:18,687
At the government's request, you see.

834
01:13:18,896 --> 01:13:24,193
They failed, and it triggered the Fall of Tokyo.

835
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:28,739
That power is still too much for--

836
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:32,201
What?!

837
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:34,036
The door's unlocked.

838
01:13:37,539 --> 01:13:38,791
Huh?

839
01:13:43,754 --> 01:13:46,632
This has got to be a trap.

840
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,716
Go back, then.

841
01:13:47,925 --> 01:13:52,012
No, we ought to find out
how much of it is a trap...

842
01:13:53,931 --> 01:13:58,894
By the way, what's
with you and that Ryu guy?

843
01:13:59,103 --> 01:14:01,021
--What do you mean?
--You're always together.

844
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:03,857
That's none of your business!

845
01:14:04,066 --> 01:14:08,779
What I'm saying is, he doesn't
know about us, does he?

846
01:14:08,987 --> 01:14:09,696
"Us"?

847
01:14:09,905 --> 01:14:13,158
Hey, wait a minute!
What's that supposed to mean?

848
01:14:13,367 --> 01:14:14,618
Do you think this will work?

849
01:14:14,827 --> 01:14:21,166
It can't be helped. At this point,
our only option is to use her.

850
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:28,090
The fact that she turned up right
under our noses says as much, I think.

851
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:29,800
I guess...

852
01:14:43,355 --> 01:14:47,526
Have arrived at Ward 13,
East Ginza intersection. Over.

853
01:14:47,734 --> 01:14:50,946
Northern District battalion has not
responded to mobilization request.

854
01:14:51,155 --> 01:14:53,782
Special search team to HQ!
Special search team to HQ!

855
01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:57,911
We're at the Haruki-ya snack bar
near the highway interchange in Ward 8.

856
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:03,959
It doesn't look like a bomb
explosion, so we think it was him.

857
01:15:04,168 --> 01:15:07,838
It was almost certainly the work of
the subject that escaped from the lab.

858
01:15:08,046 --> 01:15:10,966
Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Understood!

859
01:15:17,556 --> 01:15:18,974
Kaneda!

860
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,060
What?! Yamagata's dead?!

861
01:15:22,269 --> 01:15:24,980
Something seemed strange
about him from the second I saw him.

862
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:27,900
He was wearing what looked
like a white hospital gown.

863
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:30,903
It was like he was a different person.

864
01:15:31,111 --> 01:15:35,991
Yamagata asked him
if he was really Tetsuo.

865
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:40,579
And then... Yamagata, he...

866
01:15:43,582 --> 01:15:45,959
We've always been together.

867
01:15:46,168 --> 01:15:52,382
I've known everything about him
since we were in the children's home.

868
01:15:52,591 --> 01:15:57,346
He was a klutz, and
everybody made him cry.

869
01:15:57,554 --> 01:16:01,850
Oh, right... He wanted to
know where your bike was.

870
01:16:02,059 --> 01:16:03,810
My bike...?

871
01:16:12,152 --> 01:16:14,655
What're you gonna do?

872
01:16:14,863 --> 01:16:16,823
I'm gonna send Yamagata his bike.

873
01:16:21,745 --> 01:16:25,082
You dumb bastard!

874
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:28,961
Kaneda!

875
01:16:45,227 --> 01:16:46,687
Kei!

876
01:16:46,895 --> 01:16:48,313
What's wrong?

877
01:16:52,109 --> 01:16:55,529
You! You were there that night...

878
01:16:58,573 --> 01:17:00,158
Wait!

879
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:07,624
Kei!

880
01:17:11,044 --> 01:17:12,587
They disappeared!

881
01:17:14,256 --> 01:17:17,509
You were the ones who
changed Tetsuo too, weren't you?

882
01:17:17,718 --> 01:17:22,597
Akira's power exists within everyone.

883
01:17:22,806 --> 01:17:24,016
Who's there?!

884
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:31,398
But when that power is awakened,
even if you weren't prepared for it,

885
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:37,321
you must choose how to use it.

886
01:17:37,529 --> 01:17:40,615
And he has made his choice.

887
01:17:41,908 --> 01:17:47,080
Tetsuo is our newest companion.

888
01:17:47,289 --> 01:17:51,293
We're partly to blame for his actions.

889
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:54,546
Why did you take Kei, then?!

890
01:17:54,755 --> 01:17:57,299
We want her to help us.

891
01:17:57,507 --> 01:18:00,635
You can't just use people
like that! Bring Kei back!

892
01:18:00,844 --> 01:18:05,390
Tetsuo's our friend! If anyone's
gonna kill him, it should be us!

893
01:18:07,642 --> 01:18:09,936
Hey!

894
01:18:10,145 --> 01:18:11,480
Damn it!

895
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:15,776
Mr. Omi and the other executives
have been arrested by the coup...?

896
01:18:15,984 --> 01:18:17,027
Y-Yes, that's right.

897
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:19,654
The house guards are
fighting them right now.

898
01:18:19,863 --> 01:18:21,031
Yes.

899
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:23,742
I'd like to have a helicopter
waiting at West Haneda.

900
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:25,369
Yes.

901
01:18:25,786 --> 01:18:29,456
That damned Colonel...
I can't believe he's taken up arms.

902
01:18:32,209 --> 01:18:34,044
I underestimated him.

903
01:18:38,423 --> 01:18:40,675
Hold them here! Damn!

904
01:19:10,997 --> 01:19:12,582
Mr. Nezu...

905
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:16,128
R-Ryu?! Is that you?

906
01:19:16,336 --> 01:19:18,046
I'm sorry, sir...

907
01:19:18,255 --> 01:19:20,590
The mission was a failure.

908
01:19:20,799 --> 01:19:22,384
What are you doing here?!

909
01:19:22,592 --> 01:19:24,970
I've told you, you can't be seen here!

910
01:19:26,054 --> 01:19:27,973
All of my men...

911
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:29,891
They've all been killed.

912
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,520
Y-You sold me out,
didn't you, you bastard?!

913
01:19:33,728 --> 01:19:35,313
What? You can't be--

914
01:19:38,775 --> 01:19:40,569
Kei...

915
01:19:46,032 --> 01:19:48,743
I got fresh fish in here, buddy!
I'm gonna get compensated for 'em, right?

916
01:19:48,952 --> 01:19:52,289
Please, I have to catch a flight at noon!

917
01:19:53,123 --> 01:19:54,541
What?

918
01:19:54,749 --> 01:19:56,626
7th Avenue is just ahead!

919
01:19:56,835 --> 01:19:58,879
It intersects this road 100 meters from here!

920
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:05,051
Prepare for battle!

921
01:20:13,602 --> 01:20:17,063
Right, we've spotted the subject.

922
01:20:17,272 --> 01:20:19,524
What? Attack?!

923
01:20:19,733 --> 01:20:23,695
But he's just a... We're attacking a boy?!

924
01:20:27,574 --> 01:20:28,575
Look! There he is!

925
01:20:28,783 --> 01:20:29,367
Impossible!

926
01:20:29,576 --> 01:20:31,119
Is this for real?

927
01:20:39,085 --> 01:20:42,464
"Samurai Spirit"

928
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:44,966
Firing preparations complete.

929
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:49,513
Damn it! Fire!

930
01:21:02,734 --> 01:21:04,528
--Akira!
--It's Lord Akira!

931
01:21:04,736 --> 01:21:07,489
It's the advent of Lord Akira!

932
01:21:07,697 --> 01:21:09,282
That's not him! Don't be fooled!

933
01:21:09,491 --> 01:21:10,367
That's not Lord Akira!

934
01:21:10,575 --> 01:21:12,035
Shut up!

935
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:15,997
Long live Lord Akira!

936
01:21:16,206 --> 01:21:17,916
Fire!

937
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:19,417
Huh?

938
01:21:19,626 --> 01:21:21,044
What's wrong?

939
01:22:48,256 --> 01:22:52,761
"Akira"

940
01:22:52,761 --> 01:22:54,137
in spite of martial law in the
name of freedom of the press!

941
01:22:54,346 --> 01:22:57,974
What in the world is
happening here in Neo Tokyo?

942
01:22:58,183 --> 01:23:00,935
What you see here seems to
be fires caused by tank cannons.

943
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:03,980
But who is this young boy?

944
01:23:04,189 --> 01:23:07,275
Is he fighting the coup forces all by himself?

945
01:23:07,484 --> 01:23:13,782
Viewers, the army has just
illegally ordered us to land!

946
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:16,117
Freedom of the press is now in jeopardy!

947
01:23:16,326 --> 01:23:18,578
What happened? Were they cut off?

948
01:23:18,787 --> 01:23:20,705
The bridge! He's heading for the bridge!

949
01:23:22,582 --> 01:23:23,875
Let's go see!

950
01:23:40,558 --> 01:23:42,727
Are you really going alone?

951
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:46,189
He wants this, doesn't he?

952
01:23:46,398 --> 01:23:49,359
We should call the gang together.

953
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:50,777
Hey!

954
01:23:50,985 --> 01:23:53,405
I wouldn't want to keep him waiting.

955
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,951
Hey, Kaneda! Wait!

956
01:24:04,499 --> 01:24:06,710
Half seem to be
anti-government demonstrators.

957
01:24:06,918 --> 01:24:11,256
The rest are... Well, they're more
like some crazy cult than onlookers.

958
01:24:11,464 --> 01:24:14,592
They're following after the subject,
and more and more keep coming.

959
01:24:17,637 --> 01:24:28,148
"We Worship the Great Lord Akira"

960
01:24:28,148 --> 01:24:30,191
Consume our unclean hearts!

961
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,694
Fear not!

962
01:24:32,902 --> 01:24:38,199
Your bodies will be purified in the flames!

963
01:24:39,242 --> 01:24:40,618
Ready!

964
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:44,205
Fire!

965
01:24:49,586 --> 01:24:53,214
Set the switch to hold for three
seconds and converge your beams!

966
01:24:53,423 --> 01:24:54,382
Aim!

967
01:24:54,591 --> 01:24:56,050
Fire!

968
01:25:01,598 --> 01:25:03,767
Watch this!

969
01:25:09,481 --> 01:25:11,608
Look out! Let's get out of here!

970
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:24,120
Help me!

971
01:25:30,627 --> 01:25:33,213
Ground forces! Ground forces, come in!

972
01:25:33,421 --> 01:25:35,340
Report! What is the subject's status?!

973
01:25:35,548 --> 01:25:36,925
Ground forces!

974
01:25:38,968 --> 01:25:40,470
Call the Doctor.

975
01:25:40,678 --> 01:25:43,556
We have confirmation of his
recent movements and are in pursuit.

976
01:25:43,765 --> 01:25:46,100
His present position is... Let's see...

977
01:25:46,309 --> 01:25:51,397
Coordinates 99871 by 4332.

978
01:25:51,606 --> 01:25:55,193
That's about 2 km south of the
Olympics construction site in the old city.

979
01:25:55,401 --> 01:25:56,778
What?!

980
01:26:01,991 --> 01:26:03,868
What was that?

981
01:26:04,077 --> 01:26:05,870
Look!

982
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:09,624
That's near the toll booth that's
being guarded by the 2nd platoon.

983
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:12,210
Wha"?

984
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:13,419
Huh?

985
01:26:16,172 --> 01:26:19,926
Please turn around!
This area's off limits to civilians!

986
01:26:20,134 --> 01:26:22,554
What? That's the subject?!

987
01:26:22,762 --> 01:26:24,138
S-Stop!

988
01:26:24,347 --> 01:26:26,099
Stop, damn it!

989
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:34,042
Nice place you have here.

990
01:27:41,299 --> 01:27:44,010
Wait, you were with Kaneda.

991
01:27:44,218 --> 01:27:48,681
You shouldn't use your power this way.

992
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:49,807
What?

993
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:54,646
In the end, you won't be able to control it.

994
01:27:54,854 --> 01:27:56,147
The kids...

995
01:27:56,356 --> 01:27:58,149
You're those brats, aren't you?!

996
01:28:16,084 --> 01:28:18,044
Okay, then...!

997
01:28:40,024 --> 01:28:41,067
What the--?

998
01:28:52,662 --> 01:28:54,122
It's not safe here, Colonel!

999
01:29:35,079 --> 01:29:37,832
Well, what're you gonna do?

1000
01:31:04,502 --> 01:31:06,129
Open up!

1001
01:31:16,806 --> 01:31:18,683
What the hell?

1002
01:31:18,891 --> 01:31:21,686
That's Akira, Tetsuo!

1003
01:31:21,894 --> 01:31:25,022
That's the "Akira" you wanted to meet.

1004
01:31:25,231 --> 01:31:27,859
There's your Messiah!

1005
01:31:28,067 --> 01:31:30,403
After his transcendental awakening,

1006
01:31:30,611 --> 01:31:35,241
his body was subjected to
every test known to science.

1007
01:31:35,449 --> 01:31:39,453
And that's what was left of it.

1008
01:31:46,919 --> 01:31:48,421
"Cranial Nerve"

1009
01:31:48,504 --> 01:31:52,592
The scientists back then
were unable to solve the mystery,

1010
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,888
so they decided to entrust their
collected data and test samples

1011
01:31:57,096 --> 01:32:02,435
to future generations by
preserving them in a frozen capsule.

1012
01:32:02,643 --> 01:32:04,061
SOL... We'll use SOL!

1013
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:05,730
Sir?

1014
01:32:07,398 --> 01:32:10,276
Akira is already dead!

1015
01:32:10,484 --> 01:32:13,738
Well? Are you satisfied now, Tetsuo?

1016
01:32:18,576 --> 01:32:20,870
So come back with us!

1017
01:32:21,078 --> 01:32:22,538
Like hell!

1018
01:32:23,456 --> 01:32:25,291
Contact the central defense center

1019
01:32:25,499 --> 01:32:29,045
and tell them to patch us
through to SOL's control circuits!

1020
01:32:29,253 --> 01:32:30,671
Yes, sir!

1021
01:32:46,229 --> 01:32:48,064
Hey, watch it!

1022
01:32:48,272 --> 01:32:52,401
Damn it, move! Get out of the way!

1023
01:33:08,793 --> 01:33:11,462
What is this, science class?

1024
01:33:28,396 --> 01:33:31,399
What's wrong? Have some trouble?

1025
01:33:31,607 --> 01:33:35,194
Yeah, but I already took care of it.

1026
01:33:35,403 --> 01:33:37,321
If you were here earlier,
you could've watched the show.

1027
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:40,199
You had me worried again.

1028
01:33:40,408 --> 01:33:43,494
I figured you'd be standing here,
sobbing like a little baby.

1029
01:33:43,703 --> 01:33:48,207
Kaneda, you've always
been a pain in the ass.

1030
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:53,004
You've been telling me what
to do ever since we were kids.

1031
01:33:53,212 --> 01:33:55,172
You always treat me like a kid.

1032
01:33:55,381 --> 01:33:58,050
You always show up and
start bossing me around!

1033
01:33:58,259 --> 01:34:00,177
And now you're a boss, too...

1034
01:34:00,386 --> 01:34:02,221
Of this pile of rubble.

1035
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:03,556
Kaneda!

1036
01:34:03,764 --> 01:34:06,225
That's Mister Kaneda to you, punk!

1037
01:34:06,434 --> 01:34:08,978
Die!

1038
01:34:18,154 --> 01:34:19,572
Tetsuo!

1039
01:34:43,471 --> 01:34:45,348
Son of a...

1040
01:34:58,569 --> 01:34:59,862
Kei!

1041
01:35:01,572 --> 01:35:02,990
Oh, hell!

1042
01:35:06,619 --> 01:35:09,246
Let's do it!

1043
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,467
Got him!

1044
01:35:22,676 --> 01:35:24,261
Huh?

1045
01:35:28,724 --> 01:35:30,101
The battery?!

1046
01:35:30,309 --> 01:35:32,186
What's the matter, Kaneda?

1047
01:35:33,646 --> 01:35:35,981
God damn it! This ain't fair, Tetsuo!

1048
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:37,983
Fight with your bare hands!

1049
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:42,738
Oh, this is funny...

1050
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:46,617
Feeling frustrated, Kaneda?

1051
01:35:46,826 --> 01:35:50,162
Now do you understand how it feels?

1052
01:35:56,293 --> 01:35:58,254
What's this light?

1053
01:36:09,098 --> 01:36:10,099
Well, did you hit him?

1054
01:36:10,307 --> 01:36:13,102
We're too close to the impact point.
There's too much electrical interference.

1055
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:14,937
Prepare a second volley!

1056
01:36:37,793 --> 01:36:42,465
Hey! Kaneda!

1057
01:37:00,566 --> 01:37:03,819
Tetsuo!

1058
01:37:18,834 --> 01:37:20,419
Shit...

1059
01:37:20,628 --> 01:37:21,921
Huh?

1060
01:37:22,129 --> 01:37:23,297
What the--?

1061
01:37:59,041 --> 01:38:00,668
Correcting for tracking system error.

1062
01:38:00,876 --> 01:38:02,711
T-minus-20 to energy alteration.

1063
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:04,213
--Fire extinguishers!
--Are you okay?

1064
01:38:04,421 --> 01:38:05,005
Hurry! Hurry!

1065
01:38:05,214 --> 01:38:07,883
What happened? What's going on?

1066
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,602
Kaneda!

1067
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:21,188
Kai! Kei!

1068
01:38:21,397 --> 01:38:22,731
--Kaneda!
--Kaneda!

1069
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:23,649
Get on!

1070
01:38:23,857 --> 01:38:24,900
Get on? Where?

1071
01:38:25,109 --> 01:38:26,652
Hurry! Hurry!

1072
01:38:48,924 --> 01:38:50,426
What's that?

1073
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,734
They say it's SOL.

1074
01:39:17,411 --> 01:39:19,288
Magnificent...

1075
01:39:28,797 --> 01:39:32,801
When Tetsuo's power reaches its peak?

1076
01:39:33,010 --> 01:39:34,678
That's when we do it.

1077
01:39:34,887 --> 01:39:37,640
But will it work?

1078
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:43,270
The future doesn't
proceed along a single course.

1079
01:39:43,479 --> 01:39:47,232
There ought to be a future we can choose.

1080
01:39:56,992 --> 01:39:58,535
What's Tetsuo's status?

1081
01:39:58,744 --> 01:40:00,537
Ah, Colonel...

1082
01:40:00,746 --> 01:40:04,041
We set up a camera in the stadium a while ago.

1083
01:40:04,249 --> 01:40:05,876
We have him under observation.

1084
01:40:07,419 --> 01:40:11,423
Colonel, you must take a look at this data!

1085
01:40:11,632 --> 01:40:14,593
We're still analyzing the energy
given off by the subject, but...

1086
01:40:14,802 --> 01:40:17,638
It's magnificent. Absolutely magnificent.

1087
01:40:17,846 --> 01:40:20,516
This is clearly a proton collapse.

1088
01:40:20,724 --> 01:40:24,687
We're also detecting a fair number of
what we believe to be unknown particles.

1089
01:40:24,895 --> 01:40:27,731
If we can put this into a
theoretical framework, physics--

1090
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:29,191
No, science...

1091
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:32,528
Humanity itself could touch the
fundamental truths of the universe!

1092
01:40:34,822 --> 01:40:36,490
Oh. That's...

1093
01:40:36,699 --> 01:40:39,201
We still haven't finished
making our adjustments.

1094
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:41,578
Uh, Colonel!

1095
01:40:46,417 --> 01:40:48,377
T-That's...!

1096
01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:53,674
You bastard! What did I tell you?!

1097
01:40:53,882 --> 01:40:55,509
B-But, Colonel!

1098
01:40:55,718 --> 01:40:59,179
I couldn't throw away
such a magnificent subject!

1099
01:40:59,763 --> 01:41:02,057
Shut up!

1100
01:41:24,496 --> 01:41:26,081
Shit! It's on fire!

1101
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:27,374
The battery! The battery!

1102
01:41:27,583 --> 01:41:30,502
My bike! It's burning up!

1103
01:41:30,711 --> 01:41:33,046
Hey, what's a bike or two?

1104
01:41:33,255 --> 01:41:37,217
What? Then there's nothing
wrong with using yours, right?

1105
01:41:37,426 --> 01:41:38,427
You heard that?

1106
01:41:38,635 --> 01:41:39,678
Yeah, I did!

1107
01:41:39,887 --> 01:41:41,805
Hey, your bike's still on fire.

1108
01:42:23,347 --> 01:42:25,265
Tetsuo?

1109
01:42:36,568 --> 01:42:40,823
Tetsuo, why does
everyone call you "Akira"?

1110
01:42:41,031 --> 01:42:45,369
He never existed in the first place.

1111
01:42:45,577 --> 01:42:48,288
They didn't care who it was.

1112
01:42:50,249 --> 01:42:53,043
Just so long as he destroyed things.

1113
01:42:53,252 --> 01:42:55,546
Your arm!

1114
01:42:55,754 --> 01:42:59,424
It doesn't look like much,
but it works pretty good.

1115
01:43:02,553 --> 01:43:04,721
What's wrong? Are you okay?

1116
01:43:07,391 --> 01:43:08,934
It's nothing!

1117
01:43:09,142 --> 01:43:09,852
Tetsuo...

1118
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:11,854
Shut up! Just go away!

1119
01:43:19,570 --> 01:43:21,738
Medicine...

1120
01:43:21,947 --> 01:43:25,117
What's wrong, Tetsuo? Are you in pain?

1121
01:43:25,325 --> 01:43:28,871
Go back to the lab and
get me some of that medicine!

1122
01:43:29,079 --> 01:43:30,706
Did you hear that, Doctor?

1123
01:43:30,914 --> 01:43:32,124
Yes, Colonel.

1124
01:43:32,332 --> 01:43:34,501
Well? Can you see any signs of it?

1125
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:37,087
I'm not entirely certain,

1126
01:43:37,296 --> 01:43:41,466
but it seems that the power that had
been held back by the drugs is breaking free.

1127
01:43:41,675 --> 01:43:45,095
He may not be able to control the
power that has awakened so suddenly.

1128
01:43:45,304 --> 01:43:47,806
At any rate, he's in an
extremely dangerous condition!

1129
01:43:48,765 --> 01:43:53,395
If you don't go back to the lab and
receive proper treatment, you may die.

1130
01:43:56,231 --> 01:43:59,943
You want me to enroll in that
kindergarten and live happily ever after?

1131
01:44:00,152 --> 01:44:06,033
Take my medicine every day
and shrivel up like those kids?!

1132
01:44:10,996 --> 01:44:14,666
Kaori... Kaori...

1133
01:44:15,083 --> 01:44:18,962
Please... I need that medicine...

1134
01:44:19,171 --> 01:44:20,839
No...!

1135
01:44:21,048 --> 01:44:22,132
Tetsuo!

1136
01:44:23,717 --> 01:44:25,385
Tetsuo!

1137
01:44:27,095 --> 01:44:28,347
Tetsuo--

1138
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:02,172
Kaneda?!

1139
01:45:39,918 --> 01:45:41,253
Huh?

1140
01:45:48,552 --> 01:45:50,721
Son of a...

1141
01:45:54,182 --> 01:45:56,518
You kids... What are you doing here?

1142
01:46:02,441 --> 01:46:04,609
You never learn, do you?

1143
01:46:06,611 --> 01:46:08,697
Tetsuo!

1144
01:46:22,627 --> 01:46:24,463
Takashi...

1145
01:46:26,757 --> 01:46:28,633
Akira...

1146
01:46:28,633 --> 01:46:30,761
"Optic Nerve"

1147
01:46:41,605 --> 01:46:45,859
Kaneda...? H-Help me...!

1148
01:46:54,785 --> 01:46:56,328
Kaori...

1149
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:02,501
Help me...!

1150
01:47:13,804 --> 01:47:15,639
Help me!

1151
01:47:15,847 --> 01:47:17,933
Stop it!

1152
01:47:34,866 --> 01:47:35,659
Kaori?

1153
01:47:35,867 --> 01:47:38,703
Kaori! Kaori!

1154
01:47:38,912 --> 01:47:41,498
Tetsuo? Is that you, Tetsuo?!

1155
01:47:41,706 --> 01:47:44,668
Kaori! Kaori's gonna die!

1156
01:47:44,876 --> 01:47:47,462
What?! What did you say?!

1157
01:47:47,671 --> 01:47:50,132
My body's not doing what I tell it to!

1158
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:52,759
My power's acting on its own...!

1159
01:47:52,968 --> 01:47:55,220
Kaori!

1160
01:47:55,428 --> 01:47:57,430
Kaori's dying!

1161
01:47:57,639 --> 01:47:59,766
Kaneda, help me!

1162
01:47:59,975 --> 01:48:01,852
Stop, Tetsuo!

1163
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:04,020
Stop it!

1164
01:48:04,229 --> 01:48:08,024
Kaori's pain is coming into me...!

1165
01:48:09,651 --> 01:48:12,028
Tetsuo!

1166
01:48:12,237 --> 01:48:16,575
Kaneda! Run away!

1167
01:48:29,087 --> 01:48:31,590
Tetsuo!

1168
01:48:43,059 --> 01:48:46,855
Kiyoko! Takashi! Masaru! Get away from here!

1169
01:48:51,234 --> 01:48:52,360
Come on!

1170
01:48:58,909 --> 01:49:01,828
I can't believe it. It's as if--

1171
01:49:14,216 --> 01:49:17,510
Kiyoko! Taka--

1172
01:49:51,670 --> 01:49:55,548
Hi, Akira.

1173
01:50:04,307 --> 01:50:07,227
Th-This is...

1174
01:50:07,435 --> 01:50:09,938
But that's--Oh, no!

1175
01:50:19,072 --> 01:50:21,533
W-Where am I?

1176
01:50:21,741 --> 01:50:23,868
Hurry! Get into the tunnel!

1177
01:50:24,077 --> 01:50:25,287
You'll be safe in there.

1178
01:50:25,495 --> 01:50:27,497
Kiyoko! Where are you?

1179
01:50:42,095 --> 01:50:43,888
Tetsuo!

1180
01:50:44,097 --> 01:50:46,516
Kaneda!

1181
01:50:46,725 --> 01:50:48,101
Hang on!

1182
01:50:50,145 --> 01:50:52,564
--If you don't get out of here now, you'll--
--Out of the way!

1183
01:50:52,772 --> 01:50:54,107
Tetsuo!

1184
01:50:54,316 --> 01:50:56,359
Don't go!

1185
01:51:02,824 --> 01:51:05,201
No, Takashi!

1186
01:51:05,410 --> 01:51:08,747
If you went in now, you'd be trapped, too.

1187
01:51:08,955 --> 01:51:13,376
But none of this is his fault!

1188
01:51:19,799 --> 01:51:22,844
--Takashi!
--Takashi!

1189
01:51:29,142 --> 01:51:36,107
If we went in, we wouldn't be
strong enough to come back out.

1190
01:51:36,316 --> 01:51:40,403
But if the three of us worked together,
maybe we could at least save that boy.

1191
01:51:40,612 --> 01:51:42,113
You're right.

1192
01:51:42,322 --> 01:51:44,240
Together, the three of us could...

1193
01:51:53,041 --> 01:51:54,959
Oh, man...!

1194
01:51:55,168 --> 01:51:58,505
We should get out of here. Hey!

1195
01:51:58,713 --> 01:52:00,382
Kaneda...

1196
01:52:33,081 --> 01:52:36,459
Look, you're not revving your engine enough.

1197
01:52:36,668 --> 01:52:40,213
When you go into a corner, lean like
you're trying to kill yourself. Watch!

1198
01:52:40,422 --> 01:52:41,881
What're you doing?

1199
01:52:42,090 --> 01:52:44,134
Cornering, man.

1200
01:52:45,593 --> 01:52:47,595
Got it, Tetsuo...?

1201
01:52:53,643 --> 01:52:55,353
Look, there's another one!

1202
01:52:55,562 --> 01:52:57,689
--Another transfer student?
--He was abandoned.

1203
01:52:57,897 --> 01:52:59,941
You can see it in his face.

1204
01:53:03,653 --> 01:53:08,950
Are... Are these your dreams, Tetsuo?

1205
01:53:10,201 --> 01:53:11,411
Wait!

1206
01:54:28,738 --> 01:54:31,741
This is Akira...?

1207
01:54:31,950 --> 01:54:35,119
Yes. We called him.

1208
01:54:35,328 --> 01:54:37,413
To have him take Tetsuo away.

1209
01:54:37,622 --> 01:54:40,833
Take him away? Take him where?

1210
01:54:41,042 --> 01:54:43,211
It's too much for Tetsuo.

1211
01:54:43,419 --> 01:54:46,839
And for us. And for Akira.

1212
01:54:47,048 --> 01:54:50,593
It's too big for us as we are now.

1213
01:54:50,802 --> 01:54:54,597
But someday, we'll also be able to...

1214
01:54:54,806 --> 01:54:57,850
You see, it's already begun.

1215
01:54:58,059 --> 01:55:00,270
Your friend's--

1216
01:55:00,478 --> 01:55:02,981
My friend?

1217
01:55:03,189 --> 01:55:06,276
Kei! You mean Kei, don't you?

1218
01:55:31,759 --> 01:55:33,303
Tetsuo...

1219
01:55:38,057 --> 01:55:39,934
This is yours, right?

1220
01:55:45,732 --> 01:55:49,902
They're always like that with the
new kids. You came today, right?

1221
01:55:50,111 --> 01:55:51,613
They beat me up, too.

1222
01:55:51,821 --> 01:55:54,907
But the truth is, those guys are wimps.

1223
01:55:55,116 --> 01:56:00,872
I'm Tetsuo. Tetsuo Shima.

1224
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:04,042
To tell you the truth, I just got here myself.

1225
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:06,044
I'm

1226
01:56:06,252 --> 01:56:07,754
Kaneda...

1227
01:56:09,005 --> 01:56:11,049
Kaneda?

1228
01:56:11,257 --> 01:56:11,841
Kaneda!

1229
01:56:12,050 --> 01:56:13,343
Kei?

1230
01:56:39,077 --> 01:56:42,705
W-What's happening?
What in the world is happening?

1231
01:56:45,041 --> 01:56:47,335
B-But this isn't...

1232
01:56:47,543 --> 01:56:52,382
If this is correct, it's almost as if...
Is this the birth of a universe?!

1233
01:56:58,137 --> 01:57:01,307
Kei!

1234
01:57:06,896 --> 01:57:08,481
What happened?

1235
01:57:10,692 --> 01:57:13,277
It's disappearing...! It's disappearing!

1236
01:58:24,348 --> 01:58:27,351
Kaneda!

1237
01:58:50,082 --> 01:58:51,667
Tetsuo...

1238
01:58:54,337 --> 01:58:56,172
Kaneda...

1239
01:58:57,381 --> 01:58:58,549
Thanks.

1240
01:59:00,218 --> 01:59:03,554
You called to me, right? I heard you.

1241
01:59:10,353 --> 01:59:13,272
Kaneda, don't tell me you're...

1242
01:59:13,481 --> 01:59:15,691
What about Tetsuo?

1243
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:18,486
He left.

1244
01:59:18,694 --> 01:59:20,655
So did those three kids.

1245
01:59:20,863 --> 01:59:21,948
Akira, too.

1246
01:59:22,156 --> 01:59:24,575
Kaneda, back then, you...

1247
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:31,374
Kaneda! You're alive?!

1248
01:59:31,582 --> 01:59:38,297
I thought you were in there for sure!

1249
01:59:38,506 --> 01:59:39,382
Tetsuo...

1250
01:59:39,590 --> 01:59:41,551
What happened to Tetsuo?

1251
01:59:41,759 --> 01:59:43,010
Is he dead?!

1252
01:59:43,219 --> 01:59:46,556
I'm not so sure. But he's probably...

1253
02:00:12,373 --> 02:00:16,043
But someday, we'll also be able to...

1254
02:00:16,252 --> 02:00:18,754
You see, it's already begun.

1255
02:00:37,565 --> 02:00:42,194
I am... Tetsuo.
